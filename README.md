# Darwinism


[JAVA]

Program that simulates the evolution of a population of individuals.

Each individual has a DNA that can mutate and recombine with the DNA of an individual of opposite sex to create an offspring.

Individuals look for food, mate, and fight other individuals. They can die of hunger, old age or be killed.

Food is randomly generated within the map, and after an individual dies, it becomes food.

Individuals have states that are modelled as Markov chains.
